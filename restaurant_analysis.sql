-- Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis 
--
-- Convention: each query is a named block delimited by `-- name: <name>`.
-- db.py parses this file and exposes each block as `run_query("<name>")`,
-- so both analysis.ipynb and app.py call these exact same queries — no
-- SQL logic ever gets duplicated between the notebook and the dashboard.
--
-- Table available: `restaurants` (loaded straight from data/zomato.csv)
-- Lookup table:     `country_codes` (loaded from data/Country-Code.xlsx)

-- name: restaurants_per_country
-- Geographic distribution at the country level. The raw dataset only has a
-- numeric Country Code, so this is a straightforward join against the
-- lookup table Kaggle ships alongside it.
